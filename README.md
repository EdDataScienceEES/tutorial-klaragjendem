Building on the principles introduced in the [Reproducible Research Tutorials](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials.html) by **Coding Club**, this tutorial explores best practices for organizing, automating, and documenting R projects to enhance reproducibility and efficiency in ecological and data science research. It serves as a foundation to help you structure your research effectively, so you never have to worry about whether your project is organized correctly again!

### Pre-requisites

While this tutorial is of basic to intermediate difficulty, we recommend learners first checking the [Getting started with R and RStudio](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/intro-to-r/) and [Intro to GitHub for version control](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/git/), which will give you basic knowledge on:

- **How R and RStudio work**

- **What version control is and how to use `git`and GitHub**.



### What you will learn

In this tutorial, we will explore the essential steps to organize and manage an R project for reproducibility and efficiency. Here's a recap of what we will cover:

- **Setting Up Your Project**: Learn how to create and initialize an RStudio project as a foundation for organizing your work.

- **Setting Up a Consistent Folder Structure for Reproducibility**: Understand the importance of having a clear and logical folder organization to avoid confusion and improve workflow. Practice creating directories for key components of a project, such as data, scripts, outputs, and documentation, ensuring files are easy to locate and maintain.

- **Managing Dependencies and Package Versions with `renv`**: Learn how to use the `renv` package to create a reproducible project environment. Set up and activate `renv` to lock package versions, enabling consistent analysis even as R packages evolve.

- **Automating Your Data Cleaning and Analysis Pipeline**: Explore how to automate repetitive tasks using R scripts, saving time and reducing the risk of errors. Learn to document workflows effectively to ensure others (and your future self) can easily follow the steps.

- **Creating a Clear and Accessible README File**: Discuss the components of a professional README file, including how to provide clear context, usage instructions, and essential project details for collaborators and users.

By following these steps, you will have the tools and knowledge to build and maintain R projects that are well-organized, reproducible, and easy to share or revisit. These best practices will save you time and effort in the long run while ensuring your work is accessible and understandable to others.
